**Solution:** We prove this combinatorically using the definition of a 'word' from the first lecture. Denote $X$ as the letter for "go up" and $Y$ as the letter for "go right", then a word of length $2n$ formed by $X$ and $Y$ in which $X$ and $Y$ occur equally is a solution to the above problem. There are ${2n \choose n}$ such words. This is exactly the $n$-th Catalan number $C_n$.
